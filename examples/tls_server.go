/* Modbus TCP+TLS (MBAPS or Modbus Security) server example.
 *
 * This file is intended to be a demo of the modbus server in a tcp+tls
 * configuration.
 * It shows how to configure and start a server, as well as how to use
 * client roles to perform authorization in the handler.
 * Feel free to use it as boilerplate for simple servers.
 *
 * This server simulates a simple wall clock device, exposing a 32-bit unix
 * timestamp in holding registers #0 and 1.
 * The timestamp is incremented every second by the main loop.
 *
 * Access control is done by way of Modbus Roles, which are encoded in the
 * client certificate as an X509 extension:
 * - any client can read the clock regardless of their role, provided that their
 *   certificate is accepted by the server,
 * - only clients with the "operator" role specified in their certificate can
 *   set the time.
 *
 * Certificates with no, invalid or multiple Modbus Role extensions will have
 * their role set to an empty string (req.ClientRole == "").
 *
 * Requests from clients with certificates not passing TLS verification are
 * rejected at the TLS layer (i.e. before reaching the Modbus layer).
 *
 *
 * The following commands can be used to create self-signed server and client
 * certificates:
 * $ mkdir certs
 *
 * create the server key pair:
 * $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 360 -nodes \
 *   -keyout certs/server.key.pem -out certs/server.cert.pem \
 *   -subj "/CN=TEST SERVER CERT DO NOT USE/" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost" \
 *   -addext "keyUsage=keyCertSign,digitalSignature,keyEncipherment" \
 *   -addext "extendedKeyUsage=critical,serverAuth"
 *
 * create a client certificate with the "user" role:
 * $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 360 -nodes \
 *   -keyout certs/user-client.key.pem -out certs/user-client.cert.pem \
 *   -subj "/CN=TEST CLIENT CERT DO NOT USE/" \
 *   -addext "keyUsage=keyCertSign,digitalSignature,keyEncipherment" \
 *   -addext "extendedKeyUsage=critical,clientAuth" \
 *   -addext "1.3.6.1.4.1.50316.802.1=ASN1:UTF8String:user"
 *
 * create another client certificate with the "operator" role:
 * $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 360 -nodes \
 *   -keyout certs/operator-client.key.pem -out certs/operator-client.cert.pem \
 *   -subj "/CN=TEST CLIENT CERT DO NOT USE/" \
 *   -addext "keyUsage=keyCertSign,digitalSignature,keyEncipherment" \
 *   -addext "extendedKeyUsage=critical,clientAuth" \
 *   -addext "1.3.6.1.4.1.50316.802.1=ASN1:UTF8String:operator"
 *
 * create a file containing both client certificates (for use by the server as an
 * 'allowed client list'):
 * $ cat certs/user-client.cert.pem certs/operator-client.cert.pem >certs/clients.cert.pem
 *
 * start the server:
 * $ go run examples/tls_server.go
 *
 * in another shell, read the clock with modbus-cli as the 'user' role:
 * $ go run cmd/modbus-cli.go --target tcp+tls://localhost:5802 --cert certs/user-client.cert.pem \
 *   --key certs/user-client.key.pem --ca certs/server.cert.pem rh:uint32:0
 *
 * attempting to set the clock as 'user' should fail with Illegal Function:
 * $ go run cmd/modbus-cli.go --target tcp+tls://localhost:5802 --cert certs/user-client.cert.pem \
 *   --key certs/user-client.key.pem --ca certs/server.cert.pem wr:uint32:0:1598692358
 *
 * setting the clock as 'operator' should succeed:
 * $ go run cmd/modbus-cli.go --target tcp+tls://localhost:5802 --cert certs/operator-client.cert.pem \
 *   --key certs/operator-client.key.pem --ca certs/server.cert.pem wr:uint32:0:1598692358
 *
 * reading the cock as 'operator' should also work:
 * $ go run cmd/modbus-cli.go --target tcp+tls://localhost:5802 --cert certs/operator-client.cert.pem \
 *   --key certs/operator-client.key.pem --ca certs/server.cert.pem rh:uint32:0
